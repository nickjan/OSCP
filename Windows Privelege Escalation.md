## Introduction

Privilege escalation is the process of gaining higher levels of access on a system than what was originally granted. This is a critical skill in penetration testing, red teaming, and ethical hacking. On Windows systems, privilege escalation often involves exploiting misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, or weak permissions to gain administrative or SYSTEM-level access.

---

## Reconnaissance

The first step in privilege escalation is gathering information about the target system. This phase is called reconnaissance.

### Gather Basic Information

- **Command**: `whoami`
  - **Purpose**: Identify the current user and domain.
  - **Lookout**: Note the username and domain for context on group memberships and privileges.
  - **Example Output**:
    ```plaintext
    win-user
    ```

- **Command**: `hostname`
  - **Purpose**: Find the hostname of the machine.
  - **Lookout**: The hostname can indicate the machine's role (e.g., server, workstation).
  - **Example Output**:
    ```plaintext
    WIN-ABCD1234
    ```

### Check Group Memberships

- **Command**: `whoami /groups`
  - **Purpose**: List all groups the current user belongs to.
  - **Lookout**: Look for special privileges like `SeImpersonatePrivilege`.
  - **Example Output**:
    ```plaintext
    GROUP INFORMATION
    -----------------
    Everyone                               Well-known group
    BUILTIN\Users                          Alias
    ```

### Enumerate Users and Groups

- **Command**: `net user`
  - **Purpose**: List all user accounts on the system.
  - **Lookout**: Identify accounts with administrative privileges or known service accounts.
  - **Example Output**:
    ```plaintext
    User accounts for \\WIN-ABCD1234
    ---------------------------------
    Administrator            Guest                    win-user
    ```

- **Command**: `net localgroup`
  - **Purpose**: List all local groups.
  - **Lookout**: Check for groups like `Administrators`, `Backup Operators`, or custom groups with elevated privileges.
  - **Example Output**:
    ```plaintext
    Aliases for \\WIN-ABCD1234
    --------------------------
    *Administrators
    *Backup Operators
    *Users
    ```

### Check Operating System and Version

- **Command**: `systeminfo`
  - **Purpose**: Gather detailed information about the OS, including version and installed patches.
  - **Lookout**: Identify unpatched vulnerabilities.
  - **Example Output**:
    ```plaintext

  - **Lookout**: Identify configuration files or documents containing passwords or credentials.
  - **Example Output**:
    ```plaintext
    C:\Program Files\ExampleApp\config\password.txt
    ```

---

## Common Vulnerabilities

### Misconfigured Services

- **Description**: Services running with excessive privileges or weak permissions can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
- **Exploitation**:
  1. Identify the service using `sc query`.
  2. Replace the service binary with a malicious one.
  3. Restart the service to execute the payload.

### Weak Permissions

- **Description**: Files or directories with weak permissions can be modified by non-privileged users.
- **Exploitation**:
  1. Use `icacls` to check permissions.
  2. Replace the binary with a malicious one.
  3. Execute the binary to gain elevated privileges.

### Unquoted Service Paths

- **Description**: Services with unquoted paths can be exploited if a malicious executable is placed in a directory that is searched before the legitimate one.
- **Exploitation**:
  1. Identify unquoted service paths using `wmic service get name,pathname`.
  2. Place a malicious executable in the vulnerable directory.
  3. Restart the service to execute the payload.


     ## **Identification, Exploitation, and Mitigation**:
      The goal is to find services with unquoted paths that may be vulnerable.
      1. **Command**:
         ```bash
         wmic service get name,pathname

      ### **What to Look For**:
 
      - Inspect the service paths listed.
      - Check for paths with spaces that are **not enclosed in quotes**.

      ### **Examples**:
      - **Vulnerable Example**:  
        `C:\Program Files\Some Directory\service.exe` *(unquoted)*  
      - **Secure Example**:  
        `"C:\Program Files\Some Directory\service.exe"` *(quoted)*  
      
      ### **Why This Matters**:
      If the service executable path is unquoted and contains spaces, Windows may mistakenly execute a malicious executable located in one of the earlier directories during path resolution.
      
      ### **Exploitation - Steps to Exploit a Vulnerable Unquoted Service Path **:
      1. **Find the Vulnerable Directory**:  
         - For the path `C:\Program Files\Some Directory\service.exe`, the system might search in the following order:
           1. `C:\Program.exe`
           2. `C:\Program Files\Some.exe`
           3. `C:\Program Files\Some Directory\service.exe` *(legitimate executable)*
      
      2. **Steps to Exploit**:
         - **Create a Malicious Executable**:  
           - Develop a payload (e.g., reverse shell, keylogger, or another malicious program).  
         - **Name the Malicious Executable**:  
           - Name the file to match the vulnerable path component (e.g., `Program.exe` for `C:\Program Files`).  
         - **Place the Malicious Executable**:  
           - Place the file in the vulnerable directory (e.g., `C:\`).  
         - **Restart the Vulnerable Service**:  
           - Use the **Services GUI** or run the following command:
             ```bash
             net stop <service_name> && net start <service_name>
             ```
           - This will trigger the service to execute the malicious file instead of the legitimate one.
      
      ### **Mitigation**:
      
      To secure systems and prevent exploitation:
      
      1. **Always Quote Service Paths**:
         - Ensure service paths with spaces are enclosed in quotes.
      2. **Modify Service Configuration**:
         - Use the following command to update the service path:
           ```bash
           sc config <service_name> binPath= "\"C:\Program Files\Some Directory\service.exe\""
           ```
      ### **Summary**:
      - **Unquoted Service Paths** pose a significant risk if they contain spaces and are not properly enclosed in quotes.
      - Exploitation involves placing a malicious executable in a directory that Windows searches before the legitimate path.
      - **Mitigation**: Ensure all service paths are properly quoted to prevent this vulnerability.

### DLL Hijacking

- **Description**: Exploiting the way Windows searches for DLLs to load malicious code.
- **Exploitation**:
  1. Identify a vulnerable application using tools like `Process Monitor`.
  2. Place a malicious DLL in the target directory.
  3. Execute the application to load the malicious DLL.

---

## Exploitation Techniques

### Token Impersonation

- **Description**: Impersonating a token of a higher-privileged user to execute commands with their privileges.
- **Tool**: `incognito` in Metasploit.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use Metasploit to gain a shell on the target.
  2. Load the `incognito` module.
  3. List available tokens using `list_tokens -u`.
  4. Impersonate a token using `impersonate_token <token>`.

### Service Exploitation

- **Description**: Exploiting misconfigured services to gain higher privileges.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify a vulnerable service using `sc query`.
  2. Modify the service binary path using `sc config <service> binPath= "<malicious path>"`.
  3. Restart the service using `sc start <service>`.

### Registry Exploitation

- **Description**: Exploiting weak registry permissions to execute code.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify a vulnerable service using `reg query`.
  2. Modify the `ImagePath` to point to a malicious executable.
  3. Restart the service to execute the payload.

### Pass the Hash

- **Description**: Using a captured hash to authenticate as a user without needing the plaintext password.
- **Tool**: `Mimikatz`.
- **Steps**:
  1. Dump hashes using `Mimikatz` or `lsadump::sam`.
  2. Use the hash to authenticate using tools like `pth-winexe`.
